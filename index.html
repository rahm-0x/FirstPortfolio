    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>
      Ever since A child ive always had a big passion for computers and pushing the limits of things. I realized this much more as I got older and started playing online gaming. This is when I built my first computer and started understanding what really goes on behind the screen. Once i realized I could move some variables around in a  video games code and modify certain aspects of the game I was hooked. This is what sparked my intrest for software engineering. Outside of developing I enjoy Cars, Paintball, and trying to figure whats going to be the next 'Hot' Brand.
    </p>

    <p> As a student studying at thinkful im so happy im able to continue that intrest and begin my journey as a software engineer.
