    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p>
      Every since I child ive always had a big passion for computers and pushing the limits to things. I realized this much more as I got older and started playing online gaming. This is when i built my first computer and started understanding what really goes on behind the screen. Once i realized i could move some variables around in the games code and modify certain aspects of the game i was hooked. This i what sparked my intrest in software engineering.
    </p>

    <p> As a student studying at thinkful im so happy im able to continue that intrest and begin my journey as a software engineer</p>
