    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>
      Ever since A child I've always had a big passion for computers and pushing the limits of things. I realized this much more as I got older and started playing online gaming. This is when I built my first computer and started understanding what goes on behind the screen. Once I realized I could move some variables around in a video game's code and modify certain aspects of the game I was hooked. This is what sparked my interest in software engineering. Outside of developing I enjoy Cars, Paintball, and trying to figure what's going to be the next 'Hot' Brand.
    </p>

    <p> As a student studying at thinkful I'm so happy I'm able to continue that interest and begin my journey as a software engineer. If you're looking for a software engineer for any future hackathons, projects, or start-up ideas, feel free to contact me <a href="mailto:phoenixrabang@gmail.com">here</a></p>
